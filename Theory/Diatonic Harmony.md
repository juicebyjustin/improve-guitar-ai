The idea of **diatonic harmony** is based on the relationship between the notes of a scale and the chords that can be built from those notes. 

In any given **major** or **minor scale**, the notes in that scale can be used to create chords. These chords are referred to as **diatonic chords** because they are formed using only the notes of the scale, without any accidentals (sharps or flats that fall outside the scale).

### How It Works:

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Start with a scale**: 
   - Every scale has a set of notes, and these notes are arranged in a specific pattern of whole and half steps. For example, the **C major scale** is:  
     C, D, E, F, G, A, B

2. **Create chords from each note**:  
   - To create a chord from a note, you stack the notes in intervals of thirds (skipping every other note of the scale). A **third** is the distance between two notes (for example, from C to E is a third).
   
   Here's how you build a chord starting on each note of the **C major scale**:

   - **C major chord**: C (root), E (major third), G (perfect fifth)
   - **D minor chord**: D (root), F (minor third), A (perfect fifth)
   - **E minor chord**: E (root), G (minor third), B (perfect fifth)
   - **F major chord**: F (root), A (major third), C (perfect fifth)
   - **G major chord**: G (root), B (major third), D (perfect fifth)
   - **A minor chord**: A (root), C (minor third), E (perfect fifth)
   - **B diminished chord**: B (root), D (minor third), F (diminished fifth)

3. **The result**:  
   From each note in the scale, you create a triad (a chord with three notes). Each chord will have its own unique quality (major, minor, or diminished) depending on the intervals between the notes you choose. These are all **diatonic chords** because they only use the notes from the scale itself.

### Diatonic Harmony in Action:
The chords you get from a given scale are inherently connected to that scale and work together to form a harmonic progression. In **C major**, for example, the diatonic chords are:

- C major (I)
- D minor (ii)
- E minor (iii)
- F major (IV)
- G major (V)
- A minor (vi)
- B diminished (vii°)

This creates the basic building blocks for many chord progressions in that key, such as:

- **I – IV – V – I** (C – F – G – C)
- **I – vi – IV – V** (C – Am – F – G)

### Why This Is Important:
Diatonic harmony is the foundation of traditional Western music. It’s how chords are often built and how melodies and harmonies are constructed. By using only the notes of a given scale, you create a sense of "home" or tonality, which is crucial for understanding musical form and structure.

In summary, every scale can generate a set of chords based on the notes of that scale, and these chords form the harmonic structure that supports melodies and progressions within that key.
