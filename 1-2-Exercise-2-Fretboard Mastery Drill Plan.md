**Fretboard Mastery Drill Plan (4 Weeks)**

### **Week 1: Master the Low E and A Strings**  
**Goal:** Memorize all natural notes on these two strings.

#### **Daily Exercises (10-15 min/day)**  
1. **Play & Say:** Slowly play each **natural note** (E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E) on the **E and A strings** while saying them out loud.  
2. **Skip Around:** Instead of always moving in order, jump randomly between notes.
3. **Flash Drills:** Have a friend (or use an app) call out a noteâ€”find it fast!
4. **Octave Connection:** Locate the **same note** on different frets using octave shapes.
5. **Test Yourself:** Close your eyes, think of a note, and find it instantly.

### **Week 2: Expand to the D and G Strings**  
**Goal:** Apply octave patterns and find notes faster.

#### **Daily Exercises (10-15 min/day)**  
1. **Octave Rule:** Use the **"Two Strings Down, Two Frets Up"** rule to find notes on D and G.
2. **Full Fretboard Naming:** Play the same note (e.g., "C") on all 4 strings.
3. **Reverse It:** Start from the high frets and move back down.
4. **Chord & Scale Awareness:** Recognize these notes in **power chords and scales**.
5. **Speed Challenge:** See how fast you can name **all notes on D and G** without hesitation.

### **Week 3: Master the B and High E Strings**  
**Goal:** Cover all six strings & apply real-world playing.

#### **Daily Exercises (10-15 min/day)**  
1. **High E = Low E:** Notice that high E is the same as low E (just an octave up).
2. **Apply to Chords:** Find the root notes in common **barre chords**.
3. **Find Every Note:** Pick any note (like F) and find **all versions** across all strings.
4. **Scales & Riffs:** Play simple riffs/scales while calling out notes.
5. **Metronome Training:** Play each note on **beat with a metronome** to improve recall speed.

#### **Daily Exercises (15-20 min/day)**  
1. **Random Note Locator:** Think of a note, find it within 2 seconds.
2. **Intervals & Shapes:** Recognize patterns between **root notes and their octaves**.
3. **Improvise & Name Notes:** Jam freely while saying the notes out loud.

âœ… **Mix it into songs:** Apply the notes to riffs and solos you already enjoy.  
âœ… **Use a backing track:** Play along and try to call out every note.  
âœ… **Quiz yourself constantly:** Make it funâ€”use apps or have someone test you!  

Stick to this plan, and in a few weeks, youâ€™ll **own the fretboard!** ðŸŽ¸
