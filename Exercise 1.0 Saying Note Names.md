Yes! Saying **note names** instead of fret numbers is a much better way to **internalize the fretboard** and truly understand what you're playing.  

### **Why Say Note Names Instead of Fret Numbers?**  
âœ” **Fret numbers** tell you **where** to play but not **what** youâ€™re playing.  
âœ” **Note names** help you **visualize the scale across the entire neck**, making it easier to **improvise and connect shapes**.  
âœ” Youâ€™ll naturally learn where the **root notes** are, which helps with phrasing and soloing.

### **A Minor Pentatonic â€“ Saying the Notes Out Loud**  
The A minor pentatonic scale consists of these notes:

âœ… A - C - D - E - G


Hereâ€™s the **A minor pentatonic scale (Shape 1)** with note names:  

```
e|----------------A----C-----| (5th fret, 8th fret)  
B|----------------E----G-----| (5th fret, 8th fret)  
G|------------C----D--------| (5th fret, 7th fret)  
D|------------A----C--------| (5th fret, 7th fret)  
A|------------E----G--------| (5th fret, 7th fret)  
E|------------A----C--------| (5th fret, 8th fret)  
```

ðŸ“¢ **Say the notes out loud as you play:**  
- "A, C" (low E string)  
- "E, G" (A string)  
- "A, C" (D string)  
- "C, D" (G string)  
- "E, G" (B string)  
- "A, C" (high E string)

### **How to Practice This Efficiently**
1. **Play the scale slowly, saying each note.**  
2. **Find those same notes in different areas of the neck.**  
3. **Test yourself! Look away and try to recall the note youâ€™re playing.**  
4. **Find all the Aâ€™s** on the fretboard to anchor yourself.  

This will help you **break out of box shapes** and think in terms of music, not numbers.
