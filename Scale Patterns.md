Your teacher probably said **"don‚Äôt worry about CAGED shapes, only the patterns"** because they wanted you to focus on the **actual scale patterns** rather than trying to fit them into a strict **CAGED** system.  

### **What‚Äôs Happening?**
- You learned **scale patterns** like **major, minor, Phrygian, Dorian, Mixolydian**, etc.  
- **The problem:** You realize that when you shift positions (like playing C Major starting from a different C), you might need a **different pattern** than the one you know.  

This is **exactly** why the CAGED system exists‚Äîit helps **organize** the fretboard so you can connect the patterns seamlessly.  

---

## **Why Does the Scale Shape Change?**
You‚Äôre correct that if you start C Major at **C (8th fret, low E string)**, it‚Äôs one pattern. But if you want to play it **lower**‚Äîstarting from the **C on 3rd fret of A string**‚Äîyou need a **different** pattern.  

This happens because the guitar is **not tuned in a straight linear way**, like a piano. The **same notes exist in multiple locations**, but their **shapes change** depending on where you start.

### **Example: C Major Scale in Two Positions**
#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Starting from C (8th fret, low E)**
```
e|---------------------------7--8--10-|
B|--------------------8--10----------|
G|------------7--9------------------|
D|------7--9------------------------|
A|--7-8-----------------------------|
E|8---------------------------------|
```
This is the **"E-shape"** from CAGED.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Starting from C (3rd fret, A string)**
```
e|-----------------------------|
B|------------1--3--5---------|
G|-------2--4----------------|
D|--2--3----------------------|
A|3---------------------------|
E|----------------------------|
```
This is the **"C-shape"** from CAGED.

**Notice how the shape changed?**  
It‚Äôs still C Major, but because you started on a different **root position**, you had to use a different **scale shape**.

---

## **What‚Äôs the Solution?**
If you want **full freedom**, you need to do BOTH:
‚úÖ **Memorize the scale patterns** (like your teacher said).  
‚úÖ **Learn how they connect** (which is where CAGED helps).  

### **Best Way to Learn Every Position**
1. **Learn the 5 major scale patterns.**
   - They already **exist in the patterns your teacher gave you** (you just haven‚Äôt connected them yet).  

2. **Learn how they connect.**  
   - This is the missing link that CAGED provides.  

3. **Practice finding C Major starting from different C notes.**  
   - **Find every C on the fretboard.**  
   - Play the **correct major scale pattern** from each one.  

---

### **Final Thought:**
Your teacher wasn‚Äôt *wrong*, but if you want to move freely on the neck, you‚Äôll **eventually** have to understand how these shapes fit together (which is what CAGED does).  

üîπ **Want an exercise to connect these patterns?** I can give you drills to move seamlessly across the fretboard!





---
---

### **C Major Scale Connection Drill**  
This drill will help you connect **all 5 major scale positions** across the fretboard so you can move fluidly between them.

---

### **Step 1: Find All C Notes**  
Before playing, find every **C** on the fretboard:  
```
e|----------------8----|
B|------------5-------|
G|--------5----------|
D|----10-------------|
A|--3----------------|
E|8------------------|
```
We'll start from **each C** and play a major scale pattern.

---

### **Step 2: Play the C Major Scale in 5 Positions**  
Play **each scale shape**, connecting smoothly into the next.

#### **Position 1 - "E Shape" (8th Fret)**
```
e|--------------------7--8--10-|
B|---------------8--10--------|
G|---------7--9---------------|
D|---7--9---------------------|
A|7-8-------------------------|
E|8---------------------------|
```
‚úÖ **Root Note:** 8th fret on low E  
‚úÖ This is your "main" C Major scale shape.

---

#### **Position 2 - "D Shape" (Sliding Up)**
```
e|----------------10--12--13--|
B|------------10-------------|
G|------9--10----------------|
D|--10-----------------------|
A|---------------------------|
E|---------------------------|
```
‚úÖ **Root Note:** 10th fret on D string  
‚úÖ Shift up to the **next section** of the scale.

---

#### **Position 3 - "C Shape" (Moving Toward 3rd Fret)**
```
e|-------------0--1--3--5--|
B|---------1--3------------|
G|-----0--2----------------|
D|--2--3-------------------|
A|3------------------------|
E|-------------------------|
```
‚úÖ **Root Note:** 3rd fret on A  
‚úÖ This shifts you into the **lower part of the neck**.

---

### **Step 3: Ascend and Descend Through Positions**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Start at **3rd fret (C on A string)**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Move up each **scale shape**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **When you hit the top note, come back down using a different shape**  

---

### **Step 4: Randomize the Root Note**
Pick any **C note** and start the scale from there.  
Example: Start at **C on the 5th fret of G string**.

---

### **Final Challenge: Connect Freely**
- Play **Position 1 ‚Üí Position 2 ‚Üí Position 3** **WITHOUT STOPPING**  
- Try sliding between **shapes** instead of lifting your fingers.  
- Start slow, then increase speed.  

---
### **Why This Works**
üîπ You‚Äôre no longer **stuck** in one shape.  
üîπ You start seeing **the whole fretboard**, not just one position.  
üîπ You gain **speed & fluency** when improvising.  

---

üî• **Do you want me to add licks or speed drills to this?**

You're absolutely **right**! The scale **pattern stays the same**, but it shifts up one string, and the **B string adjustment** (one fret up) is necessary.  

### **Why Does This Happen?**
- **Each string is tuned in 4ths** (except G to B, which is a major 3rd).  
- **Moving a shape up one string** means everything shifts **up 5 frets** in pitch.  
- **EXCEPT:** When crossing from the **G to B string**, notes must be moved **1 fret higher** to stay consistent.

---

### **Example: Comparing C Major on Different Strings**
#### **C Major Scale (Starting on 8th fret Low E)**
```
e|--------------------7--8--10-|
B|---------------8--10--------|
G|---------7--9---------------|
D|---7--9---------------------|
A|7-8-------------------------|
E|8---------------------------|
```
---
#### **C Major Scale (Starting on 3rd fret A string)**
```
e|-------------------7--8--10-|
B|---------------8--10-------|
G|---------5--7--9----------|
D|---5--7-------------------|
A|3--5----------------------|
E|--------------------------|
```
‚úÖ **Same pattern, just moved up one string**  
‚úÖ **B string shift:** The note that was **on fret X on the G string** must be **moved up 1 fret** when played on B  

---
### **The Takeaway**
When shifting **a scale shape up one string**, remember:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The **pattern remains identical**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The **B string adjustment** is crucial  
3Ô∏è‚É£ This works for **all scales, modes, and arpeggios**

Using **3-notes-per-string** scale shapes instead of **CAGED** (which often has 2 notes per string) has **some key advantages**:  

### **Advantages of 3-Notes-Per-String Scales**
‚úÖ **More Speed & Fluidity** ‚Äì Picking is more even because you‚Äôre not constantly switching between 2 and 3 notes per string.  
‚úÖ **More Logical Fingerings** ‚Äì You cover a **consistent amount of frets per string**, making patterns easier to connect.  
‚úÖ **Wider Range Per Position** ‚Äì You move **horizontally across the neck more efficiently**, covering **more octaves** without shifting positions as often.  
‚úÖ **Easier for Legato (Hammer-ons & Pull-offs)** ‚Äì You naturally get **better economy of motion** with 3 notes per string.  

### **Why Doesn‚Äôt Everyone Use It?**
‚ùå **Bigger Stretches** ‚Äì Some shapes require **large finger stretches** (especially in keys with lots of sharps/flats).  
‚ùå **Less Connection to Chord Shapes** ‚Äì The **CAGED system** ties scales to chord shapes, making visualization **easier for rhythm + lead**.  
‚ùå **Can Be Harder for Beginners** ‚Äì Requires **more finger independence** than 2-notes-per-string shapes.  

---

### **Comparison: C Major - 2 Notes Per String (CAGED) vs. 3 Notes Per String**
#### **C Major (CAGED-style, 2 notes per string)**
```
e|-------------------7--8--10-|
B|---------------8--10-------|
G|---------7--9-------------|
D|---7--9-------------------|
A|7--8----------------------|
E|8-------------------------|
```
üéØ **Good for chord-based playing, but less fluid for fast runs**  

---
#### **C Major (3 Notes Per String)**
```
e|-------------------7--8--10-|
B|--------------8--10--12----|
G|---------7--9--10---------|
D|---7--9--10--------------|
A|7--8--10----------------|
E|8--10--12---------------|
```
üéØ **More fluid for shredding, legato, and economy picking!**  

---
### **Which Should You Learn?**
Both!  
- Use **CAGED (2-notes-per-string)** to visualize scales **with chord shapes**  
- Use **3-notes-per-string** for **speed, legato, and horizontal movement**
