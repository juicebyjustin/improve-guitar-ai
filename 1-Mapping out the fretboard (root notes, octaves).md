Mapping out the fretboard (root notes, octaves)?


Great choice! Mapping out **root notes and octaves** will help you break free from thinking in numbers and start seeing the fretboard as a connected system.

### **Step 1: Learn the Natural Notes on the Low E and A Strings**  
You donâ€™t need to memorize the whole fretboard yetâ€”just the notes on the **Low E and A strings** because they define where scales and chords are rooted.

#### **Low E String (6th string)**
```
E  - F  - F# - G  - G# - A  - A# - B  - C  - C# - D  - D# - E  
0   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10   11   12  
```
  
#### **A String (5th string)**
```
A  - A# - B  - C  - C# - D  - D# - E  - F  - F# - G  - G# - A  
0   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10   11   12  
```

ðŸŽ¯ **Exercise:**  
1. Pick a note (like A).  
2. Find it on **both the E and A strings**.  
3. Play it back and forth until you can find it instantly.

### **Step 2: Learn the Octave Shapes**
An **octave** is the same note but higher in pitch. The easiest way to find octaves is to use these **shapes**:

#### **1. "Two Strings Down, Two Frets Up" Rule**
- Find a note on the **E or A string**.
- The **octave** is two strings down (higher) and two frets up.

ðŸŽ¯ **Example:**
- **Find the 5th fret (A) on the Low E string**.
- Its **octave** is at the 7th fret on the D string.

```
E|----------------------  
B|----------------------  
G|------------------2---  <-- Octave  
D|------------7----  
A|-------5----  
E|--5------  
```

ðŸ”¹ This shape works **everywhere except between G and B strings** (which is offset by one fret).

---

#### **2. The "Same Fret, Two Strings Up" Rule**
If youâ€™re on the **D or G string**, the octave is **on the same fret, two strings up**.

ðŸŽ¯ **Example:**
- Find **7th fret on D (A note)**.
- Its **octave is at the 7th fret on the B string**.

```
E|-----------7----  
B|------7----  
G|-----------  
D|--7------  
A|-----------  
E|-----------  
```

### **Step 3: Apply It to Chords and Scales**
Now, you can use **root notes and octaves to find scales and chords faster**.

#### **Finding A Minor Scale Root Notes**
- A is at **5th fret E string, 12th fret A string**.
- Use **octave shapes** to find all the **Aâ€™s** across the neck.

ðŸŽ¯ **Exercise:**
1. Play **all the A notes** on the fretboard using these shapes.
2. Play an **A minor scale**, starting from each A.
3. Do this for other root notes (like G, D, or C).

### **What This Does for You**
âœ… You **stop relying on fret numbers** and start seeing how notes connect.  
âœ… You can **move around the neck freely**, rather than staying in one box.  
âœ… You can **find any scale or chord instantly** just by locating the root notes.

### **Next Step: Want to Apply This to a Scale or Chord Progression?**  
We can take what you just learned and use it to **play A minor scales all over the fretboard**, so youâ€™re no longer stuck in one shape. Want to try that next?
