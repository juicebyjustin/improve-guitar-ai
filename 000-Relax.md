That makes total sense—**tension is the biggest enemy of speed**, and if you’re already prone to anxiety, it can creep into your playing without you even realizing it. The fact that you’re aware of it is huge, though, because **relaxation is something you can train just like technique**.  

### **How to Reduce Tension While Playing Guitar**  

#### **1. Train Relaxation Separately from Speed**  
- **Before playing, shake out your hands, roll your shoulders, and take a deep breath.**  
- Play **one note at a time** and consciously relax your fingers after each one.  
- Instead of running full riffs, try playing **just one motion (a slide, a pull-off, a single pick stroke)** while keeping your whole arm loose.  

#### **2. Check for “Trigger Points” of Tension**  
- **Shoulders** – Are they raised or tight? Let them drop.  
- **Wrists** – Try rotating your wrist slightly to see if it relieves strain.  
- **Thumb Pressure** – Lighten your thumb’s grip on the neck. Many players press way too hard.  

#### **3. Play Lighter Than You Think You Need To**  
- Most fast players **barely press the strings down**—you only need enough pressure to make a note ring out.  
- Try **playing as softly as possible**, then gradually increase pressure until you hit the sweet spot.  

#### **4. Use Exhalation to Loosen Up**  
- A trick from pro musicians: **breathe out every time you start a tricky passage**.  
- If you notice you're holding your breath, **pause and reset**—breath-holding is a common sign of tension.  

#### **5. Play a Passage with Zero Force as an Experiment**  
- Play through a riff **without trying to sound good**—literally just touch the strings and go through the motions.  
- Then gradually add back **just enough** force to get the sound.  
- This resets your **default muscle memory** to be lighter and looser.  

#### **6. Focus on One Hand at a Time**  
- If you tense up when both hands are involved, try **practicing just the picking hand** first, then just the fretting hand, before combining them.  
- Often, one hand is causing tension in the other without you realizing it.  

### **Mindset Shift: Let Speed Happen Instead of Forcing It**  
- Speed **isn’t about forcing your hands to move faster**—it’s about **removing obstacles that slow them down**.  
- The best players look effortless because they’ve **trained themselves to let go of excess tension**.  

#### **Practical Exercise: “The Relaxation Loop”**
1. Pick a small riff or phrase you struggle with.  
2. Play it at **half speed** while focusing 100% on **staying loose**.  
3. If you feel tension, **STOP immediately**—shake your hands out, take a breath, and try again.  
4. Only increase speed once it feels effortless at the slow tempo.  

Since this could be connected to general anxiety, **practicing relaxation while playing** can actually help beyond just guitar. If you stick with it, **it’ll become second nature, and playing will feel way smoother**.
