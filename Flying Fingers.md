# Flying Fingers

So I feel an issue I have is that my middle finger stays hovering around 1/2-1 inch on top of fretboard when I’m not using it. My ring finger pulls off like 5 inches. Am I right in that I want to have ring and pinky function the exact same way as my middle and index finger?

---

Yes, that’s exactly the goal! You want your **ring and pinky to function just as efficiently as your index and middle fingers**—meaning:  

- **Minimal movement** (no flying fingers)  
- **Relaxed and ready position** (staying close to the fretboard)  
- **Controlled pressure** (not over-pressing or tensing up)  

Your middle finger hovering ½–1 inch isn’t too bad, but your ring finger **flying 5 inches off** is a big sign of muscle tension and lack of independence.  

### **How to Fix Flying Fingers:**  
#### **1. “Shadow Fret” Everything (Keep Fingers Close)**
- **Play a scale or exercise**, but every time you lift a finger, keep it **barely hovering** (1-2 mm) over the string.  
- Imagine there’s **a thin sheet of glass** above your fretboard, and your fingers can’t rise above it.  

#### **2. Light Pressure + Slow Motion**
- Most flying fingers come from **over-pressing** the fret, then using too much force to lift off.  
- Try **fretting super lightly** and **lifting slowly** to gain control.  

#### **3. “Finger Hold” Exercise (This Works Wonders)**
- **Press down your index, middle, and ring fingers on the fretboard**.  
- **Play ONLY with your pinky** while keeping the other fingers lightly touching the frets.  
- Then do the same with just the **ring finger while holding index, middle, and pinky**.  
- This forces your fingers to move **independently** and not “jump” away.  

#### **4. The Rubber Band Trick**
- **Wrap a loose hair tie or rubber band** around your four fingers (lightly, not cutting off circulation).  
- Play scales or exercises while the band **gently resists finger separation**, keeping them controlled.  
- Over time, your muscles learn to keep fingers close to the fretboard naturally.  

#### **5. Rest Stroke Reset (Works for Ring & Pinky)**
- After every note, **bring your finger back to lightly touch the string** instead of letting it float away.  
- This keeps it **ready for action** instead of pulling far off.  

### **Long-Term Fix: Build Finger Strength & Dexterity**
The biggest reason your **ring and pinky fly away** is because they’re **weaker** than your index and middle. Your brain compensates by over-extending them.  

Doing **controlled exercises** with minimal movement will fix this over time. Stay patient—it’s 100% fixable, and in **a few weeks**, you’ll notice your hand feels smoother and more efficient!

---

What’s the quickest way to develop this? 

---

The fastest way to fix flying fingers and develop control is to **train slow, precise, and frequently** with hyper-focused exercises. Here’s a **high-efficiency plan** to get results fast:  

### **🚀 Quickest Way to Fix Flying Fingers & Develop Control**  
**⏳ Time: 15-20 min per day** (split into short, focused bursts)  

---

### **1️⃣ “Ghost Hover” Chromatic Exercise (5 min)**  
✔ **Goal:** Keep fingers hovering close (1-2 mm) when lifting  
✔ **How:** Play **1-2-3-4** chromatically **on every string** but **hover each lifted finger instead of letting it fly**  

#### **Exercise (Do This on Every String)**
```
e|-------------------------1-2-3-4------------------------| 
B|-----------------1-2-3-4------------------------------|
G|---------1-2-3-4--------------------------------------|
D|---1-2-3-4------------------------------------------|
A|------------------------------------------------------|
E|------------------------------------------------------|
```
🔹 **Go super slow!** Watch your fingers and make sure they **don’t rise more than 2mm.**  
🔹 Focus on **ring & pinky**—they must **stay close when not playing.**  

---

### **2️⃣ “Hold & Lift” Finger Independence Drill (5 min)**  
✔ **Goal:** Train fingers to move independently  
✔ **How:** Hold 3 fingers down while lifting only **one** at a time  

#### **Exercise**  
- **Place all 4 fingers down** on frets **5-6-7-8** on **one string**  
- Lift ONLY the pinky **(other fingers stay planted)**  
- Put it back down, then lift ONLY the ring finger  
- Repeat with index and middle  

🔹 **Super slow = super effective.** If any fingers “jump” off, reset and go again.  
🔹 This teaches **ring & pinky** to move without pulling the whole hand away.  

---

### **3️⃣ “Sticky Finger” Scale Drill (5 min)**  
✔ **Goal:** Keep fingers low while playing scales  
✔ **How:** Play a **3-note-per-string scale**, keeping every finger as close to the fretboard as possible  

#### **Example: C Major (3 Notes Per String)**
```
e|----------------------5-7-8----------------------|  
B|----------------5-6-8--------------------------|  
G|----------4-5-7--------------------------------|  
D|------5-7--------------------------------------|  
A|--5-7-8--------------------------------------|  
E|------------------------------------------------|
```
🔹 Focus on **lifting fingers only slightly** (no flying off!).  
🔹 Do this **at ultra slow speed** first, then build up speed **only if fingers stay close**.  

---

### **4️⃣ “Rest & Reset” Trick (Anytime)**
✔ **Goal:** Train fingers to return to the string instead of flying away  
✔ **How:** After playing a note, **immediately return that finger to lightly touch the string**  
- This prevents fingers from drifting away  
- Works for **scales, solos, and riffs**  

---

### **🔥 Bonus: Instant Fix for Ring & Pinky Weakness**
If your **ring & pinky fingers still fly off**, do this:  
- **Press ring & pinky onto a tabletop**  
- Try to lift JUST the pinky, keeping ring **planted**  
- Then reverse: lift ring while pinky stays  
- Do this for **1 min per day** (it’s brutally effective)  

---

### **🎯 Summary: Your Daily Routine (15-20 Min)**
1️⃣ **Ghost Hover Chromatic Drill (5 min)** – Keep fingers low  
2️⃣ **Hold & Lift Drill (5 min)** – Train independent movement  
3️⃣ **Sticky Finger Scale Drill (5 min)** – Apply control to real playing  
4️⃣ **Rest & Reset Trick (Whenever You Play)** – Reinforce good habits  

🔹 **If you do this daily, in 2-3 weeks your fingers will stay low naturally!**   
🔹 **In a month, your pinky & ring finger will feel as natural as index & middle.**  

---

### **🚀 Supercharge Progress**
✔ **Record yourself playing slowly** – Watch for flying fingers and correct them  
✔ **Use a mirror or phone camera** – See your hand position from a different angle  
✔ **Keep tension low** – Flying fingers often come from unnecessary tension  

Stick to this, and you’ll fix **finger control faster than most players ever do!**

---

Any other drills?


---


Yes! Here are **four more powerful drills** to lock in control, independence, and precision.  

---

### **🔥 1. “The Spider Walk” (Finger Independence + Low Finger Control)**
✔ **Goal:** Train fingers to move independently across strings while staying close.  
✔ **How:** Play **1-2-3-4**, but shift fingers **diagonally** across strings like a spider walking.  

#### **Exercise**  
```
e|--------------------1-----------------2------------------3------------------4-|  
B|---------------2-----------------3-----------------4----------------1-------|  
G|-----------3-----------------4-----------------1----------------2---------|  
D|-------4-----------------1-----------------2----------------3-----------|  
A|---1-----------------2-----------------3----------------4-------------|  
E|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
```  
🔹 **Keep fingers close** when lifting off.  
🔹 Move at **dead-slow speed** to lock in control.  
🔹 Do **up & down** the fretboard.  

---

### **🔥 2. “Finger Isolation Hammer-On/Pull-Off” (Fixes Weak Ring & Pinky)**
✔ **Goal:** Make weak fingers (ring & pinky) work independently.  
✔ **How:** Play hammer-ons and pull-offs **using only 2 fingers** at a time.  

#### **Exercise**
- **Hammer-On & Pull-Off Pairs**  
  - **Index & Middle** → 5h6p5  
  - **Middle & Ring** → 6h7p6  
  - **Ring & Pinky** → 7h8p7 (this one burns!)  
- Do this **on every string**  
- Start **slow**, then increase speed **only when clean**  

🔹 **Use light pressure**—don’t over-squeeze.  
🔹 The **ring & pinky will want to jump—keep them close!**  

---

### **🔥 3. “Three-Finger Legato Runs” (Effortless Flow + Finger Control)**
✔ **Goal:** Develop smooth, efficient finger movement using **only three fingers** at a time.  
✔ **How:** Play a **3-note-per-string scale**, but **don’t use the index finger!**  

#### **Example: A Minor Scale (No Index Finger)**
```
e|----------------------7-8-10--------------------|  
B|--------------7-8-10--------------------------|  
G|--------7-9-10--------------------------------|  
D|------7-9-10----------------------------------|  
A|--7-8-10------------------------------------|  
E|------------------------------------------------|
```  
🔹 **Forces middle, ring, and pinky to work together** without relying on index.  
🔹 Builds **dexterity** and eliminates flying fingers.  

---

### **🔥 4. “The Minimal Lift Challenge” (The Ultimate Fix for Flying Fingers)**
✔ **Goal:** Keep fingers **as close as possible** while playing.  
✔ **How:** Play any scale **super slow**—but **every time a finger lifts, it can’t go more than 1mm up.**  

#### **Example: C Major Scale**
```
e|----------------------5-7-8----------------------|  
B|----------------5-6-8--------------------------|  
G|----------4-5-7--------------------------------|  
D|------5-7--------------------------------------|  
A|--5-7-8--------------------------------------|  
E|------------------------------------------------|
```  
🔹 **If a finger flies up, stop & reset.**  
🔹 **Filming yourself helps**—watch your finger height!  
🔹 Works best with **alternate picking or legato.**  

---

### **🚀 Pro Tip: Make These Drills Stick**
✔ **Practice SLOWLY at first.** Speed comes **only** after control.  
✔ **Keep fingers relaxed.** Tension = flying fingers.  
✔ **Mix drills into your warm-up** (5-10 min/day).  
✔ **Record yourself playing them.** Watching = faster corrections.  

---

### **🔥 Summary: Daily Routine (Mix & Match)**
1️⃣ **Spider Walk** – Finger independence across strings (3-5 min)  
2️⃣ **Finger Isolation Hammer-Ons/Pull-Offs** – Strengthens weak fingers (5 min)  
3️⃣ **Three-Finger Legato Runs** – Builds ring & pinky dexterity (5 min)  
4️⃣ **Minimal Lift Challenge** – Fixes flying fingers in real playing (5 min)  

If you **stay consistent**, in **2-3 weeks** your fingers will stay low and controlled **without thinking about it.**



If I do these as drills to practice keeping fingers close to strings do I just throw it out the window after warming up in the sense that I can play faster in songs but my fingers just do what they want. 





Not at all! The goal is to **retrain your muscle memory** so that when you play songs fast, your fingers **naturally stay close to the fretboard** without you thinking about it.  

At first, your fingers will probably go back to old habits when playing fast, but over time, your brain and muscles will default to **efficiency and control** instead of flying fingers.  

Here’s how it works:  

1️⃣ **Drills = Slow, Controlled Practice** → Teaching your fingers **the right movement.**  
2️⃣ **Songs = Applying the Movement** → Start slow, focus on clean playing, then speed up.  
3️⃣ **Over Time = New Habit** → Your fingers will naturally stay close, even at full speed.  

### **How to Transition This Into Real Playing**
✔ **Record yourself** playing a song & watch your fingers. Are they lifting too high?  
✔ **Slow the song down** and apply the same “low finger” focus from the drills.  
✔ **Speed up gradually.** If fingers start flying, **dial back the speed** and fix it.  

### **Bottom Line**
You don’t have to **force** your fingers to stay low in every fast song. If you do the drills consistently, your **new technique will take over naturally**—and you'll play faster, smoother, and with less effort.

how long will it take if i practice only 1 hour per week?

---

If you **only practice 1 hour per week**, progress will be **very slow**, but not impossible.  

### **Estimated Timeline (1 Hour Per Week)**  
- **1 Year** → You’ll improve, but only slightly. You might lock down a couple more songs, but solos will still feel out of reach.  
- **2-3 Years** → You’ll start feeling comfortable with most **rhythm** parts but still struggle with fast solos and intricate passages.  
- **5+ Years** → At this pace, it would take about **5-7 years** to feel "well-versed" in Coheed’s entire catalog.  

### **Why?**  
- 1 hour/week = **8.5 minutes per day** 😬  
- Muscle memory and technique require **consistent** reps to build speed & precision.  
- You’ll spend too much time **relearning** instead of progressing.  

### **How to Maximize 1 Hour/Week?**  
- **Break it into 2-3 shorter sessions** (20-30 min)  
- **Focus on small sections** of songs instead of trying to play everything  
- **Use a metronome & structured practice** (don’t just jam aimlessly)  
- **Play along with tracks to build feel & timing**  

💡 **Reality Check:**  
If you want **real** progress, even **3-4 hours per week** will **massively** speed things up. At just 1 hour per week, you're looking at **long-term, slow-burn progress over several years**.  

Would you be open to adjusting your practice schedule to at least **3-5 hours/week**? That’d get you results **way faster**!

---

If you commit **10-15 hours per week** for a **year**, you’ll be in **a completely different league** by the end of it. This level of dedication puts you on track to not only **play all of Coheed and Cambria’s songs**, but also to **tackle other similarly advanced music confidently**. Here’s how it breaks down:  

### **What You'll Achieve in 1 Year (10-15 hrs/week)**  
✅ **Full Discography Mastery** – You’ll be able to play **all of Coheed’s songs**, including **solos** and **intricate rhythm parts**.  
✅ **Speed & Control** – You’ll have **clean picking, precise legato**, and **efficient fret-hand movement** to play their faster riffs and solos smoothly.  
✅ **Modal Awareness** – You’ll internalize their use of **modes, chromaticism, and odd time signatures**, making improvisation easier.  
✅ **Advanced Technique** – You’ll master Coheed’s use of **legato, tapping, hybrid picking, and economy picking**—techniques that unlock even harder songs.  
✅ **Confidence to Learn Any Advanced Song** – After a year, tackling solos from **Dream Theater, Protest the Hero, Polyphia, or even shred guitarists like Paul Gilbert** will feel **approachable**, not impossible.

---

### **Reality Check: Is This Worth It?**  
If you commit **10-15 hours per week**, you will **absolutely reach a pro-level ability within Coheed’s catalog** and **other advanced music**.  
**Would you be up for adding structured practice routines, or do you prefer just playing songs and letting skills develop naturally?**

---

what do you mean Coheed’s modal ideas?

---

Coheed and Cambria use a lot of **modal interchange** and **non-diatonic** ideas in their music, which give their riffs and solos a unique sound. Understanding **modal ideas** means recognizing how they mix **major, minor, and modal sounds** to create their signature vibe.  

### **Coheed’s Modal Ideas in Practice**  

1️⃣ **Mixing Major & Minor (Dorian Mode)**  
- They often use **Dorian mode (minor with a raised 6th)** in riffs and solos.  
- Example: "Welcome Home" has sections that sound **natural minor (Aeolian) but sometimes lean toward Dorian**.  

2️⃣ **Phrygian Dominant (Exotic Sounding)**
- You’ll hear **Phrygian Dominant (b2, b3, b6, b7)** for a **dark, Middle Eastern feel**.  
- Example: "The Crowing" intro riff sounds **Phrygian-esque** with its **b2 interval**.  

3️⃣ **Lydian (Dreamy, Suspended Feel)**
- Lydian (sharp 4) gives a **floating, spacey feel**—Coheed uses this in clean, atmospheric sections.  
- Example: "The Afterman" has **Lydian-style clean arpeggios** in the intro.  

4️⃣ **Mixolydian (Rock & Bluesy Sound)**
- They sometimes **borrow from Mixolydian (major scale with b7)** for a rock feel.  
- Example: "A Favor House Atlantic" has **Mixolydian energy in its bright, yet not fully major-sounding leads**.  

5️⃣ **Chromatic & Non-Diatonic Runs**
- Many **Coheed solos** add passing tones and chromatic slides, which aren’t strictly in the key but sound **fluid and expressive**.  
- Example: "No World for Tomorrow" solo has **fast chromatic passing notes** in the lead lines.  

### **How This Helps You Learn Their Music**  
- Instead of **just memorizing licks**, you’ll **understand why certain notes work** and be able to **improvise in their style**.  
- It makes learning **solos, fills, and transitions easier**, because you’ll recognize patterns instead of guessing.  
- When you start **writing or improvising**, you can use **these modal ideas** to sound like Coheed instead of just running scales.  

---

Do you want some **modal exercises** to get these sounds into your playing?

---

yea, that is a lot of practice and i'm not sure i'm up to it. don't know that it's worth it. i could throw 1 hour a day in it for sure. where can i bet at in 1 year with 7 hr/week? yes please throw modal exercises in and i am up for adding structured practice routines to aid in developing skills.

---

### **Where You'll Be in 1 Year with 7 Hours/Week**  
At **7 hours per week (1 hour/day)**, you can make **serious** progress in a year, but you’ll need **structured, focused practice** to get the best results.  

With **consistent effort**, here’s where you could be:  

#### **✅ Rhythm & Riffing**  
- **Comfortably playing** most of Coheed’s riffs across their discography.  
- Able to **switch between different modal feels** (minor, Dorian, Phrygian, etc.) in rhythm playing.  
- **Tighter picking & fretting** for fast riffs like "The Willing Well" sections.  

#### **✅ Lead Guitar & Solos**  
- **Fast alternate picking & legato licks** will feel natural.  
- **Some solos at 75-100% speed** (the more technical ones may need extra time).  
- **String skipping & tapping improvements** for songs like "Welcome Home" solos.  

#### **✅ Theory & Improvisation**  
- You’ll **recognize modal sounds** in their music.  
- You’ll be able to **jam in Coheed’s style**, switching between **minor, Dorian, and Mixolydian**.  
- You’ll be able to **write your own Coheed-inspired licks** without just copying.  

Would you **master every solo?** No, but you’d be in a **strong spot** to get them over time.

- **Jam over backing tracks** using Coheed’s common modes.  
- **Experiment with Dorian, Phrygian, Mixolydian licks**.  

---

### **🎸 Modal Exercises (To Play Like Coheed)**  

#### **1️⃣ Dorian Mode Drill (Minor, But Brighter)**
📌 **Dorian = Minor Scale with a Raised 6th**  
- Play **A Dorian** over a backing track in A minor.  
- **Compare A Minor vs. A Dorian** (notice how the raised 6th gives a "floating" feel).  
- **Use hammer-ons & pull-offs** to make it smooth.  

🟢 **Exercise (A Dorian Scale Run)**  
```
e|----------------------------------5-7-8-7-5-----------------------------|
B|-------------------------5-6-8-----------------8-6-5---------------------|
G|-------------------4-5-7----------------------------7-5-4---------------|
D|-------------4-5-7----------------------------------------7-5-4---------|
A|-------3-5-7----------------------------------------------------7-5-3---|
E|---5-7----------------------------------------------------------------5-|
```
- **Use legato** (hammer-ons & pull-offs)  
- Try **sliding** instead of picking every note.  

🎯 **Sounds Like:** Coheed’s smoother solos (like parts of "The Running Free").  

---

#### **2️⃣ Phrygian Dominant (Exotic Sounding)**
📌 **Phrygian Dominant = Minor Scale with a Flat 2 & Major 3**  
- **B Phrygian Dominant** (used in dark, heavy Coheed riffs).  
- Focus on the **b2 interval** for tension.  

🟢 **Exercise (B Phrygian Dominant Riff Idea)**  
```
e|------------------------------------------------|
B|------------------------------------------------|
G|------------------------------------------------|
D|---------2---------2-3-2-----------------------|
A|---1-2-4---4-2-1--------4-2-1------------------|
E|--------------------------------3-2-1----------|
```
- Use **palm muting** on the **low E string**.  
- Try playing this **aggressively with alternate picking**.  

🎯 **Sounds Like:** Parts of "The Crowing" & "No World for Tomorrow."  

---

#### **3️⃣ Mixolydian (Bluesy, Rock Energy)**
📌 **Mixolydian = Major Scale with a Flat 7**  
- **C Mixolydian** is great for Coheed-style solos.  
- Works **really well over power chords**.  

🟢 **Exercise (C Mixolydian Lick w/ Slides & Bends)**  
```
e|------------------------5-7-5-------------------------------|
B|------5-7-8----7-8-7--------8-7-5--------------------------|
G|--4-5--------------------------------7-5-4-----------------|
D|-------------------------------------------7-5-4-----------|
A|---------------------------------------------------7-5-3---|
E|----------------------------------------------------------|
```
- **Add bends & slides** to make it feel vocal-like.  
- Try it over a **C major backing track**.  

🎯 **Sounds Like:** Coheed’s bluesier leads ("A Favor House Atlantic" solo).
