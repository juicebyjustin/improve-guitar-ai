# Flying Fingers

So I feel an issue I have is that my middle finger stays hovering around 1/2-1 inch on top of fretboard when I’m not using it. My ring finger pulls off like 5 inches. Am I right in that I want to have ring and pinky function the exact same way as my middle and index finger?

---

Yes, that’s exactly the goal! You want your **ring and pinky to function just as efficiently as your index and middle fingers**—meaning:  

- **Minimal movement** (no flying fingers)  
- **Relaxed and ready position** (staying close to the fretboard)  
- **Controlled pressure** (not over-pressing or tensing up)  

Your middle finger hovering ½–1 inch isn’t too bad, but your ring finger **flying 5 inches off** is a big sign of muscle tension and lack of independence.  

### **How to Fix Flying Fingers:**  
#### **1. “Shadow Fret” Everything (Keep Fingers Close)**
- **Play a scale or exercise**, but every time you lift a finger, keep it **barely hovering** (1-2 mm) over the string.  
- Imagine there’s **a thin sheet of glass** above your fretboard, and your fingers can’t rise above it.  

#### **2. Light Pressure + Slow Motion**
- Most flying fingers come from **over-pressing** the fret, then using too much force to lift off.  
- Try **fretting super lightly** and **lifting slowly** to gain control.  

#### **3. “Finger Hold” Exercise (This Works Wonders)**
- **Press down your index, middle, and ring fingers on the fretboard**.  
- **Play ONLY with your pinky** while keeping the other fingers lightly touching the frets.  
- Then do the same with just the **ring finger while holding index, middle, and pinky**.  
- This forces your fingers to move **independently** and not “jump” away.  

#### **4. The Rubber Band Trick**
- **Wrap a loose hair tie or rubber band** around your four fingers (lightly, not cutting off circulation).  
- Play scales or exercises while the band **gently resists finger separation**, keeping them controlled.  
- Over time, your muscles learn to keep fingers close to the fretboard naturally.  

#### **5. Rest Stroke Reset (Works for Ring & Pinky)**
- After every note, **bring your finger back to lightly touch the string** instead of letting it float away.  
- This keeps it **ready for action** instead of pulling far off.  

### **Long-Term Fix: Build Finger Strength & Dexterity**
The biggest reason your **ring and pinky fly away** is because they’re **weaker** than your index and middle. Your brain compensates by over-extending them.  

Doing **controlled exercises** with minimal movement will fix this over time. Stay patient—it’s 100% fixable, and in **a few weeks**, you’ll notice your hand feels smoother and more efficient!

What’s the quickest way to develop this? 

---

The fastest way to fix flying fingers and develop control is to **train slow, precise, and frequently** with hyper-focused exercises. Here’s a **high-efficiency plan** to get results fast:  

### **🚀 Quickest Way to Fix Flying Fingers & Develop Control**  
**⏳ Time: 15-20 min per day** (split into short, focused bursts)  

---

### **1️⃣ “Ghost Hover” Chromatic Exercise (5 min)**  
✔ **Goal:** Keep fingers hovering close (1-2 mm) when lifting  
✔ **How:** Play **1-2-3-4** chromatically **on every string** but **hover each lifted finger instead of letting it fly**  

#### **Exercise (Do This on Every String)**
```
e|-------------------------1-2-3-4------------------------| 
B|-----------------1-2-3-4------------------------------|
G|---------1-2-3-4--------------------------------------|
D|---1-2-3-4------------------------------------------|
A|------------------------------------------------------|
E|------------------------------------------------------|
```
🔹 **Go super slow!** Watch your fingers and make sure they **don’t rise more than 2mm.**  
🔹 Focus on **ring & pinky**—they must **stay close when not playing.**  

---

### **2️⃣ “Hold & Lift” Finger Independence Drill (5 min)**  
✔ **Goal:** Train fingers to move independently  
✔ **How:** Hold 3 fingers down while lifting only **one** at a time  

#### **Exercise**  
- **Place all 4 fingers down** on frets **5-6-7-8** on **one string**  
- Lift ONLY the pinky **(other fingers stay planted)**  
- Put it back down, then lift ONLY the ring finger  
- Repeat with index and middle  

🔹 **Super slow = super effective.** If any fingers “jump” off, reset and go again.  
🔹 This teaches **ring & pinky** to move without pulling the whole hand away.  

---

### **3️⃣ “Sticky Finger” Scale Drill (5 min)**  
✔ **Goal:** Keep fingers low while playing scales  
✔ **How:** Play a **3-note-per-string scale**, keeping every finger as close to the fretboard as possible  

#### **Example: C Major (3 Notes Per String)**
```
e|----------------------5-7-8----------------------|  
B|----------------5-6-8--------------------------|  
G|----------4-5-7--------------------------------|  
D|------5-7--------------------------------------|  
A|--5-7-8--------------------------------------|  
E|------------------------------------------------|
```
🔹 Focus on **lifting fingers only slightly** (no flying off!).  
🔹 Do this **at ultra slow speed** first, then build up speed **only if fingers stay close**.  

---

### **4️⃣ “Rest & Reset” Trick (Anytime)**
✔ **Goal:** Train fingers to return to the string instead of flying away  
✔ **How:** After playing a note, **immediately return that finger to lightly touch the string**  
- This prevents fingers from drifting away  
- Works for **scales, solos, and riffs**  

---

### **🔥 Bonus: Instant Fix for Ring & Pinky Weakness**
If your **ring & pinky fingers still fly off**, do this:  
- **Press ring & pinky onto a tabletop**  
- Try to lift JUST the pinky, keeping ring **planted**  
- Then reverse: lift ring while pinky stays  
- Do this for **1 min per day** (it’s brutally effective)  

---

2️⃣ **Finger Isolation Hammer-Ons/Pull-Offs** – Strengthens weak fingers (5 min)  
3️⃣ **Three-Finger Legato Runs** – Builds ring & pinky dexterity (5 min)  
4️⃣ **Minimal Lift Challenge** – Fixes flying fingers in real playing (5 min)  

If you **stay consistent**, in **2-3 weeks** your fingers will stay low and controlled **without thinking about it.**



If I do these as drills to practice keeping fingers close to strings do I just throw it out the window after warming up in the sense that I can play faster in songs but my fingers just do what they want. 





Not at all! The goal is to **retrain your muscle memory** so that when you play songs fast, your fingers **naturally stay close to the fretboard** without you thinking about it.  

At first, your fingers will probably go back to old habits when playing fast, but over time, your brain and muscles will default to **efficiency and control** instead of flying fingers.  

Here’s how it works:  

1️⃣ **Drills = Slow, Controlled Practice** → Teaching your fingers **the right movement.**  
2️⃣ **Songs = Applying the Movement** → Start slow, focus on clean playing, then speed up.  
3️⃣ **Over Time = New Habit** → Your fingers will naturally stay close, even at full speed.  

### **How to Transition This Into Real Playing**
✔ **Record yourself** playing a song & watch your fingers. Are they lifting too high?  
✔ **Slow the song down** and apply the same “low finger” focus from the drills.  
✔ **Speed up gradually.** If fingers start flying, **dial back the speed** and fix it.  

### **Bottom Line**
You don’t have to **force** your fingers to stay low in every fast song. If you do the drills consistently, your **new technique will take over naturally**—and you'll play faster, smoother, and with less effort.
