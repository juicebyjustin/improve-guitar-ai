# Flying Fingers

So I feel an issue I have is that my middle finger stays hovering around 1/2-1 inch on top of fretboard when I’m not using it. My ring finger pulls off like 5 inches. Am I right in that I want to have ring and pinky function the exact same way as my middle and index finger?

---

Yes, that’s exactly the goal! You want your **ring and pinky to function just as efficiently as your index and middle fingers**—meaning:  

- **Minimal movement** (no flying fingers)  
- **Relaxed and ready position** (staying close to the fretboard)  
- **Controlled pressure** (not over-pressing or tensing up)  

Your middle finger hovering ½–1 inch isn’t too bad, but your ring finger **flying 5 inches off** is a big sign of muscle tension and lack of independence.  

### **How to Fix Flying Fingers:**  
#### **1. “Shadow Fret” Everything (Keep Fingers Close)**
- **Play a scale or exercise**, but every time you lift a finger, keep it **barely hovering** (1-2 mm) over the string.  
- Imagine there’s **a thin sheet of glass** above your fretboard, and your fingers can’t rise above it.  

#### **2. Light Pressure + Slow Motion**
- Most flying fingers come from **over-pressing** the fret, then using too much force to lift off.  
- Try **fretting super lightly** and **lifting slowly** to gain control.  

#### **3. “Finger Hold” Exercise (This Works Wonders)**
- **Press down your index, middle, and ring fingers on the fretboard**.  
- **Play ONLY with your pinky** while keeping the other fingers lightly touching the frets.  
- Then do the same with just the **ring finger while holding index, middle, and pinky**.  
- This forces your fingers to move **independently** and not “jump” away.  

#### **4. The Rubber Band Trick**
- **Wrap a loose hair tie or rubber band** around your four fingers (lightly, not cutting off circulation).  
- Play scales or exercises while the band **gently resists finger separation**, keeping them controlled.  
- Over time, your muscles learn to keep fingers close to the fretboard naturally.  

#### **5. Rest Stroke Reset (Works for Ring & Pinky)**
- After every note, **bring your finger back to lightly touch the string** instead of letting it float away.  
- This keeps it **ready for action** instead of pulling far off.  

### **Long-Term Fix: Build Finger Strength & Dexterity**
The biggest reason your **ring and pinky fly away** is because they’re **weaker** than your index and middle. Your brain compensates by over-extending them.  

Doing **controlled exercises** with minimal movement will fix this over time. Stay patient—it’s 100% fixable, and in **a few weeks**, you’ll notice your hand feels smoother and more efficient!

---

What’s the quickest way to develop this? 

---

The fastest way to fix flying fingers and develop control is to **train slow, precise, and frequently** with hyper-focused exercises. Here’s a **high-efficiency plan** to get results fast:  

### **🚀 Quickest Way to Fix Flying Fingers & Develop Control**  
**⏳ Time: 15-20 min per day** (split into short, focused bursts)  

---

### **1️⃣ “Ghost Hover” Chromatic Exercise (5 min)**  
✔ **Goal:** Keep fingers hovering close (1-2 mm) when lifting  
✔ **How:** Play **1-2-3-4** chromatically **on every string** but **hover each lifted finger instead of letting it fly**  

#### **Exercise (Do This on Every String)**
```
e|-------------------------1-2-3-4------------------------| 
B|-----------------1-2-3-4------------------------------|
G|---------1-2-3-4--------------------------------------|
D|---1-2-3-4------------------------------------------|
A|------------------------------------------------------|
E|------------------------------------------------------|
```
🔹 **Go super slow!** Watch your fingers and make sure they **don’t rise more than 2mm.**  
🔹 Focus on **ring & pinky**—they must **stay close when not playing.**  

---

### **2️⃣ “Hold & Lift” Finger Independence Drill (5 min)**  
✔ **Goal:** Train fingers to move independently  
✔ **How:** Hold 3 fingers down while lifting only **one** at a time  

#### **Exercise**  
- **Place all 4 fingers down** on frets **5-6-7-8** on **one string**  
- Lift ONLY the pinky **(other fingers stay planted)**  
- Put it back down, then lift ONLY the ring finger  
- Repeat with index and middle  

🔹 **Super slow = super effective.** If any fingers “jump” off, reset and go again.  
🔹 This teaches **ring & pinky** to move without pulling the whole hand away.  

---

### **3️⃣ “Sticky Finger” Scale Drill (5 min)**  
✔ **Goal:** Keep fingers low while playing scales  
✔ **How:** Play a **3-note-per-string scale**, keeping every finger as close to the fretboard as possible  

#### **Example: C Major (3 Notes Per String)**
```
e|----------------------5-7-8----------------------|  
B|----------------5-6-8--------------------------|  
G|----------4-5-7--------------------------------|  
D|------5-7--------------------------------------|  
A|--5-7-8--------------------------------------|  
E|------------------------------------------------|
```
🔹 Focus on **lifting fingers only slightly** (no flying off!).  
🔹 Do this **at ultra slow speed** first, then build up speed **only if fingers stay close**.  

---

### **4️⃣ “Rest & Reset” Trick (Anytime)**
✔ **Goal:** Train fingers to return to the string instead of flying away  
✔ **How:** After playing a note, **immediately return that finger to lightly touch the string**  
- This prevents fingers from drifting away  
- Works for **scales, solos, and riffs**  

---

### **🔥 Bonus: Instant Fix for Ring & Pinky Weakness**
If your **ring & pinky fingers still fly off**, do this:  
- **Press ring & pinky onto a tabletop**  
- Try to lift JUST the pinky, keeping ring **planted**  
- Then reverse: lift ring while pinky stays  
- Do this for **1 min per day** (it’s brutally effective)  

---

### **🎯 Summary: Your Daily Routine (15-20 Min)**
1️⃣ **Ghost Hover Chromatic Drill (5 min)** – Keep fingers low  
2️⃣ **Hold & Lift Drill (5 min)** – Train independent movement  
3️⃣ **Sticky Finger Scale Drill (5 min)** – Apply control to real playing  
4️⃣ **Rest & Reset Trick (Whenever You Play)** – Reinforce good habits  

🔹 **If you do this daily, in 2-3 weeks your fingers will stay low naturally!**   
🔹 **In a month, your pinky & ring finger will feel as natural as index & middle.**  

---

### **🚀 Supercharge Progress**
✔ **Record yourself playing slowly** – Watch for flying fingers and correct them  
✔ **Use a mirror or phone camera** – See your hand position from a different angle  
✔ **Keep tension low** – Flying fingers often come from unnecessary tension  

Stick to this, and you’ll fix **finger control faster than most players ever do!**

---

Any other drills?


---


Yes! Here are **four more powerful drills** to lock in control, independence, and precision.  

---

### **🔥 1. “The Spider Walk” (Finger Independence + Low Finger Control)**
✔ **Goal:** Train fingers to move independently across strings while staying close.  
✔ **How:** Play **1-2-3-4**, but shift fingers **diagonally** across strings like a spider walking.  

#### **Exercise**  
```
e|--------------------1-----------------2------------------3------------------4-|  
B|---------------2-----------------3-----------------4----------------1-------|  
G|-----------3-----------------4-----------------1----------------2---------|  
D|-------4-----------------1-----------------2----------------3-----------|  
A|---1-----------------2-----------------3----------------4-------------|  
E|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
```  
🔹 **Keep fingers close** when lifting off.  
🔹 Move at **dead-slow speed** to lock in control.  
🔹 Do **up & down** the fretboard.  

---

### **🔥 2. “Finger Isolation Hammer-On/Pull-Off” (Fixes Weak Ring & Pinky)**
✔ **Goal:** Make weak fingers (ring & pinky) work independently.  
✔ **How:** Play hammer-ons and pull-offs **using only 2 fingers** at a time.  

#### **Exercise**
- **Hammer-On & Pull-Off Pairs**  
  - **Index & Middle** → 5h6p5  
  - **Middle & Ring** → 6h7p6  
  - **Ring & Pinky** → 7h8p7 (this one burns!)  
- Do this **on every string**  
- Start **slow**, then increase speed **only when clean**  

🔹 **Use light pressure**—don’t over-squeeze.  
🔹 The **ring & pinky will want to jump—keep them close!**  

---

### **🔥 3. “Three-Finger Legato Runs” (Effortless Flow + Finger Control)**
✔ **Goal:** Develop smooth, efficient finger movement using **only three fingers** at a time.  
✔ **How:** Play a **3-note-per-string scale**, but **don’t use the index finger!**  

#### **Example: A Minor Scale (No Index Finger)**
```
e|----------------------7-8-10--------------------|  
B|--------------7-8-10--------------------------|  
G|--------7-9-10--------------------------------|  
D|------7-9-10----------------------------------|  
A|--7-8-10------------------------------------|  
E|------------------------------------------------|
```  
🔹 **Forces middle, ring, and pinky to work together** without relying on index.  
🔹 Builds **dexterity** and eliminates flying fingers.  

---

### **🔥 4. “The Minimal Lift Challenge” (The Ultimate Fix for Flying Fingers)**
✔ **Goal:** Keep fingers **as close as possible** while playing.  
✔ **How:** Play any scale **super slow**—but **every time a finger lifts, it can’t go more than 1mm up.**  

#### **Example: C Major Scale**
```
e|----------------------5-7-8----------------------|  
B|----------------5-6-8--------------------------|  
G|----------4-5-7--------------------------------|  
D|------5-7--------------------------------------|  
A|--5-7-8--------------------------------------|  
E|------------------------------------------------|
```  
🔹 **If a finger flies up, stop & reset.**  
🔹 **Filming yourself helps**—watch your finger height!  
🔹 Works best with **alternate picking or legato.**  

---

### **🚀 Pro Tip: Make These Drills Stick**
✔ **Practice SLOWLY at first.** Speed comes **only** after control.  
✔ **Keep fingers relaxed.** Tension = flying fingers.  
✔ **Mix drills into your warm-up** (5-10 min/day).  
✔ **Record yourself playing them.** Watching = faster corrections.  

---

### **🔥 Summary: Daily Routine (Mix & Match)**
1️⃣ **Spider Walk** – Finger independence across strings (3-5 min)  
2️⃣ **Finger Isolation Hammer-Ons/Pull-Offs** – Strengthens weak fingers (5 min)  
3️⃣ **Three-Finger Legato Runs** – Builds ring & pinky dexterity (5 min)  
4️⃣ **Minimal Lift Challenge** – Fixes flying fingers in real playing (5 min)  

If you **stay consistent**, in **2-3 weeks** your fingers will stay low and controlled **without thinking about it.**



If I do these as drills to practice keeping fingers close to strings do I just throw it out the window after warming up in the sense that I can play faster in songs but my fingers just do what they want. 





Not at all! The goal is to **retrain your muscle memory** so that when you play songs fast, your fingers **naturally stay close to the fretboard** without you thinking about it.  

At first, your fingers will probably go back to old habits when playing fast, but over time, your brain and muscles will default to **efficiency and control** instead of flying fingers.  

Here’s how it works:  

1️⃣ **Drills = Slow, Controlled Practice** → Teaching your fingers **the right movement.**  
2️⃣ **Songs = Applying the Movement** → Start slow, focus on clean playing, then speed up.  
3️⃣ **Over Time = New Habit** → Your fingers will naturally stay close, even at full speed.  

### **How to Transition This Into Real Playing**
✔ **Record yourself** playing a song & watch your fingers. Are they lifting too high?  
✔ **Slow the song down** and apply the same “low finger” focus from the drills.  
✔ **Speed up gradually.** If fingers start flying, **dial back the speed** and fix it.  

### **Bottom Line**
You don’t have to **force** your fingers to stay low in every fast song. If you do the drills consistently, your **new technique will take over naturally**—and you'll play faster, smoother, and with less effort.

how long will it take if i practice only 1 hour per week?

---

If you **only practice 1 hour per week**, progress will be **very slow**, but not impossible.  

### **Estimated Timeline (1 Hour Per Week)**  
- **1 Year** → You’ll improve, but only slightly. You might lock down a couple more songs, but solos will still feel out of reach.  
- **2-3 Years** → You’ll start feeling comfortable with most **rhythm** parts but still struggle with fast solos and intricate passages.  
- **5+ Years** → At this pace, it would take about **5-7 years** to feel "well-versed" in Coheed’s entire catalog.  

### **Why?**  
- 1 hour/week = **8.5 minutes per day** 😬  
- Muscle memory and technique require **consistent** reps to build speed & precision.  
- You’ll spend too much time **relearning** instead of progressing.  

### **How to Maximize 1 Hour/Week?**  
- **Break it into 2-3 shorter sessions** (20-30 min)  
- **Focus on small sections** of songs instead of trying to play everything  
- **Use a metronome & structured practice** (don’t just jam aimlessly)  
- **Play along with tracks to build feel & timing**  

💡 **Reality Check:**  
If you want **real** progress, even **3-4 hours per week** will **massively** speed things up. At just 1 hour per week, you're looking at **long-term, slow-burn progress over several years**.  

Would you be open to adjusting your practice schedule to at least **3-5 hours/week**? That’d get you results **way faster**!

---

If you commit **10-15 hours per week** for a **year**, you’ll be in **a completely different league** by the end of it. This level of dedication puts you on track to not only **play all of Coheed and Cambria’s songs**, but also to **tackle other similarly advanced music confidently**. Here’s how it breaks down:  

### **What You'll Achieve in 1 Year (10-15 hrs/week)**  
✅ **Full Discography Mastery** – You’ll be able to play **all of Coheed’s songs**, including **solos** and **intricate rhythm parts**.  
✅ **Speed & Control** – You’ll have **clean picking, precise legato**, and **efficient fret-hand movement** to play their faster riffs and solos smoothly.  
✅ **Modal Awareness** – You’ll internalize their use of **modes, chromaticism, and odd time signatures**, making improvisation easier.  
✅ **Advanced Technique** – You’ll master Coheed’s use of **legato, tapping, hybrid picking, and economy picking**—techniques that unlock even harder songs.  
✅ **Confidence to Learn Any Advanced Song** – After a year, tackling solos from **Dream Theater, Protest the Hero, Polyphia, or even shred guitarists like Paul Gilbert** will feel **approachable**, not impossible.
