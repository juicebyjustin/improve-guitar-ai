### **Applying Pentatonic Connections to a Real Lick (A Minor)**
Now that you know how to **connect shapes**, let’s apply that in a **real lick** that sounds musical and helps you break out of box shapes.  

This lick will:  
✔ **Move across multiple positions** using slides.  
✔ **Use pull-offs & hammer-ons** to sound smooth.  
✔ **Target root notes (A)** to keep it melodic.

🎸 **Breaking It Down**:
1️⃣ **Bars 1-2**: Classic **box shape hammer-ons & pull-offs** (Shape 1).  
2️⃣ **Bars 3-4**: **Slide up from Shape 1 to Shape 2** on G string (7→9).  
3️⃣ **Bars 5-6**: Move **into Shape 3** with a slide on the D string (7→10).  
4️⃣ **Bar 7**: End on **high E bend** (targeting A note at 8th fret).

### **🎯 Why This Works**
- **It flows naturally between shapes** instead of getting stuck in one box.  
- **Slides & hammer-ons keep it smooth** and avoid choppy playing.  
- **It resolves on a root note (A)**, making it sound finished.

### **How to Use This Lick in a Solo**
- **Play it over an A minor backing track** 🎵.  
- **Experiment by changing the ending note** to match a chord change.  
- **Use different rhythms** (triplets, slower phrasing) to make it feel more expressive.
