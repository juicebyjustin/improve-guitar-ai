I feel like I am stuck at almost being intermediate at Guitar. When I was learning a riff of a song a few months ago, I realized I was focusing too much on what numbers must finger should be on and what string in the number of front my fingers should be on. Because I do not read music I do not know music theory I played music since sixth grade 20 years ago so I can play I have musicality. I have rhythm but music theory and learning music and knowing the scales and chords on a guitar, I just do not know. I’ve taught myself Guitar in seventh grade by myself using guitar tabs online that was 20 years ago. I feel that not having music theory and knowing skills and shapes and chords, and just everything else that goes along with music theory is really holding me back because my mind is focusing too much on what to put my finger on when it could just know based on how the music sounds, you know what notes are coming up because I have no music theory are know something. I’ve attributed this to not knowing music theory and what’s holding me back from the Guitar, but I don’t know if that’s true.  

It sounds like you’re at a crossroads with your guitar playing—where your musicality and rhythm are strong, but your **lack of music theory and fretboard knowledge** is making things feel more mechanical than intuitive. This is super common for self-taught players, and you’re not alone in feeling this way.

### **Is Music Theory Really Holding You Back?**
Not necessarily. Plenty of great players don’t have formal music theory knowledge but play by ear and instinct. However, **a little theory can go a long way**—not to replace your ear, but to **support it** so you’re not always guessing at what comes next.

Right now, it sounds like:
- You have **good musicality and rhythm**, which is huge.
- You can **learn songs**, but it feels like a slow, mechanical process.
- You **don't visualize the fretboard intuitively**—you think about numbers rather than knowing where the notes are.
- You feel like **you don’t "just know" what notes come next**, which makes playing less fluid.

### **What Would Help You Improve?**
Rather than diving deep into abstract theory, focus on **practical knowledge** that will **improve your ability to move freely on the fretboard** and **understand what you're playing** without overthinking. Here’s what I’d recommend:

#### **1. Learn the Fretboard (But Keep It Simple)**
You don’t have to memorize **every note**, but knowing where the **root notes** are will **help you stop relying on tab numbers** and instead start seeing shapes.  
- **First, learn the notes on the Low E and A strings** (since these define your chord and scale positions).
- **Then, recognize octaves** (ex: an A on the 5th fret of the E string is also at the 7th fret of the D string).
- **Visualize notes instead of numbers**—try saying the note names out loud as you play.

#### **2. Get Comfortable with Scale Shapes (Don’t Overcomplicate It)**
- Start with the **minor pentatonic scale** (it’s used in rock, blues, metal, and more).
- Learn the **natural minor scale** (you were already practicing A minor).
- **Instead of memorizing patterns blindly**, try playing **along with a backing track** and focus on how the notes feel and sound.

#### **3. Stop Thinking in Numbers—Think in Movement**
- If you see **5-8 on the Low E string**, instead of thinking, “Okay, 5th fret, then 8th fret,”  
  → Think, “Root note, then minor third.”  
- If you see **5-7-8 on the B string**, instead of thinking, “Okay, those frets,”  
  → Think, “A, B, C—I know where that lands in the scale.”  
- This shift will help your brain process **the function of the notes** instead of just muscle memory.

#### **4. Play Chord Progressions and Recognize Shapes**
- If you play a **G chord**, try finding those notes elsewhere on the neck.
- Learn **triads** and **basic barre chord shapes**, so you can move them around.
- If you learn **common progressions (like I-IV-V or ii-V-I)**, songs will start to make sense without needing tabs.

#### **5. Transcribe More (Even Just Small Riffs)**
- Instead of **always looking up tabs**, try figuring out simple riffs **by ear**.
- Example: Play a song you know well and try to hum along—then match those hums to notes.
- Even doing this with small phrases will make your ear stronger.

### **What’s the Goal?**
Your goal isn’t to **become a theory expert** overnight. It’s to:
✅ **Stop thinking about frets as numbers and start thinking in patterns, intervals, and sounds.**  
✅ **Know the fretboard well enough that you aren’t hunting for the next note.**  
✅ **Understand how scales and chords relate, so music feels less like a puzzle and more like a language.**  

I think **music theory isn't what’s holding you back—it’s your fretboard knowledge and pattern recognition.** You already have the musical instinct; theory will just make things click faster.

### **What’s Your Next Step?**
Would you want to start with:
1. **Mapping out the fretboard (root notes, octaves)?**
2. **Learning the minor pentatonic shape and making it feel natural?**
3. **Working on interval recognition (so you know where notes "should" go next)?**
