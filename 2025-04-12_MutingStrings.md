how to keep non played strings muted with picking hand. i don't have trouble muting higher strings with my index finger. the issue is when i'm on B and high-E strings that i have trouble muting the low strings with my picking hand palm

# AI
Great question — and you're 100% on a very real challenge that most players hit when they start working lower down on the strings like B and high E.

When you're playing on the **B or high E strings**, it's essential to use your **picking hand palm, thumb, and even other fingers** to mute the **lower (thicker) strings**, especially E, A, and D, which are prone to ringing sympathetically.

Here’s how to manage that muting efficiently:

---

### 🔇 Muting Lower Strings with Your Picking Hand

#### ✅ **Use the Side of Your Palm**
- While picking, rest the **edge of your palm (pinky side)** lightly on the low E and A strings.  
- The contact should be gentle — enough to stop the string from ringing but not so much that it interferes with your pick movement.
- This works best when your hand is slightly angled and **hovering closer to the bridge**.

#### ✅ **Thumb Muting**
- Let your **thumb rest on the low E string** while you're picking the B or high E.  
- Many players naturally position the thumb this way when alternate picking or hybrid picking.
- This is especially helpful if you're **not palm muting aggressively**.

#### ✅ **Floating Hand Anchoring**
- If you tend to “float” your picking hand rather than anchoring it, you can **lightly touch** the low strings with your ring finger or pinky while picking — this requires finesse and may take time to develop.

### 👊 Practice Exercise
Here’s a quick way to isolate and practice this:

1. Pick any riff on the **B or E string**.
2. Lightly palm-mute the **E, A, and D strings** as you play.
3. Try playing it **with and without muting** and listen to the difference in unwanted noise.
4. Gradually **add speed**, making sure muting remains clean.

---

### 🧠 Pro Tip
Muting isn't just a technical tool — it's part of your **tone** and **tightness**. The better you get at it, the more pro your playing will sound, especially for **Coheed-style riffs** where open strings or unintentional noise can cloud the clarity.

# Me
if i'm playing scale using all 6 strings it's difficult for me to shift my hand to mute lower string when playing higher strings. how to work on specifically this? 

# AI
Yeah — totally relatable. That shift in technique when you move across all 6 strings, especially ascending to the higher ones, is **super awkward at first**. The key is to **train your right hand (picking hand)** to automatically take over muting duties as your fretting hand moves up the strings.

Here’s a focused breakdown and practice strategy just for this issue:

---

### 🎯 What’s Going Wrong
When you're playing a **scale across all 6 strings**, especially when moving to the **B and high E strings**, your **fretting hand is no longer in position to mute** the lower ones. So the picking hand needs to **compensate by shifting and resting lightly** on the lower strings without breaking your picking flow.

---

### 💡 Technique Shift to Work On

#### 1. **Train Your Palm Glide**
As you move from the low strings to the high strings (e.g., E → A → D → G → B → e), practice **gliding your palm** down slightly so it naturally covers the strings you’re done with.

- Think of your palm as a curtain slowly closing over the strings behind you.
- Rest the **side of your palm (near pinky and wrist)** across E/A/D strings once you're on B or e.

You don’t need full-on palm muting — just enough contact to deaden the strings.

---

#### 2. **Thumb Anchor Practice**
You can use your **thumb (or base of thumb)** to start muting the low E (and even A) as you ascend. Try this in slow motion:
- As you ascend past D string, **touch your thumb** lightly to the E string.
- Build muscle memory by **pausing intentionally** at this shift.

### 🧘 Focused Practice Exercise

#### 🧩 Exercise: **Muted Scale Shift Drill**
1. Choose a **3-notes-per-string scale** (like A minor or E minor).
2. Play slowly across all 6 strings, ascending and descending.
3. **Mute all strings behind your pick** as you go:
   - As you move to the next higher string, mute the one you just left.
   - By the time you hit B or e, you should have your picking hand palm lightly resting across E-A-D-G.

🎥 Record yourself doing this to **check for ringing notes** behind your playing.

### 🔁 Practice Daily for 5 Minutes
If you give this 5 focused minutes daily, it will start to **feel automatic in about a week or two** — even at faster tempos.

Would you like me to write you a simple scale tab that’s ideal for practicing this exact muting transition?
