The same thought process **can** work for power chord transitions, but there are some key differences in technique and movement:  

### **How It’s Similar:**  
1. **Finger Groupings & Patterns:**  
   - Just like with single-note exercises, you can practice power chords in **fixed finger groupings** (e.g., index + ring, index + pinky).  
   - You can also break down power chord transitions into **two-finger** or **three-finger** movements.  

2. **Ascending & Descending Motion:**  
   - You can practice power chords **moving up and down the neck** in a structured way, similar to the finger exercises.  
   - Example: Moving a **5th power chord (root + 5th)** up the low E string fret by fret.  

3. **Metronome & Rhythmic Variation:**  
   - Practicing **with a metronome** using different rhythmic divisions (eighths, triplets, etc.) helps with precision and timing.  

4. **Positioning & Momentum:**  
   - Finger exercises involve shifting fingers toward or away from the bridge. Power chord exercises can do the same—**start in one position and systematically shift toward the bridge or neck.**  

### **Where It’s Different:**  
1. **String Skipping & Lateral Movement:**  
   - Power chord transitions involve **bigger hand shifts** than single-note exercises.  
   - Instead of just finger independence, you need **hand and wrist coordination** to keep the chord shape intact while moving.  

2. **Hand Anchoring & Grip Strength:**  
   - Single-note drills focus on **finger independence**, while power chords rely on a **stable wrist position and grip strength** to keep the shape consistent.  
   - This means you need to practice **lifting and repositioning the entire chord shape smoothly.**  

3. **Chord Shape Memory Instead of Note-by-Note Thinking:**  
   - Finger exercises often train you to **think in terms of individual notes**, while power chords benefit more from **muscle memory and pattern-based movements.**  
   - You don’t necessarily need to name every note, but you do need to **visualize fretboard shapes quickly.**  

### **How to Adapt This Method to Power Chords:**  
- **Step 1: Two-Finger Groupings** → Practice switching between two power chords using only index and ring fingers (e.g., A5 → G5).  
- **Step 2: Three-Finger Groupings** → Add the pinky for three-note power chords (e.g., A5 → C5 → D5).  
- **Step 3: Ascending & Descending Movement** → Move up/down the neck in small sections (e.g., 5th fret → 7th fret → 10th fret).  
- **Step 4: Rhythm & Metronome Practice** → Use different note divisions (eighths, triplets, swung eighths) to develop timing.  
- **Step 5: String-Jumping & Position Shifts** → Introduce movements between strings (e.g., E5 → A5 on different strings).  

By applying the structured **finger grouping, ascending/descending transitions, rhythmic drills, and gradual expansion**, you can build clean, fast, and effortless power chord changes.
