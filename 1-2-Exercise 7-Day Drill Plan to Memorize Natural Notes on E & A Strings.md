Hereâ€™s a **step-by-step drill plan** along with a **printable chart** to help you **learn all the natural notes on the E and A strings efficiently.**

### **ðŸŽ¯ 7-Day Drill Plan to Memorize Natural Notes on E & A Strings**  

#### **Day 1-2: Single String Naming**  
- **Goal:** Play and say each natural note **out loud** in order on one string at a time.  
- **Exercise:**  
  1. Start with the **low E string (6th string)**  
     - Play: **E - F - G - A - B - C - D - E** (frets: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12)  
     - Say the note names out loud as you play.  
  2. Repeat the same process for the **A string (5th string)**  
     - Play: **A - B - C - D - E - F - G - A** (frets: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12)  
  3. Repeat both strings **descending** (going back down).  

---

#### **Day 3-4: Random Note Jumping**  
- **Goal:** Instantly recognize and play a natural note anywhere on the E or A string.  
- **Exercise:**  
  1. Have a friend **call out a note** (or use flashcards).  
  2. Find that note **quickly** on both E and A strings.  
  3. Time yourselfâ€”try to get faster each day.  

---

#### **Day 5: Skip Notes & Use a Metronome**  
- **Goal:** Increase speed and accuracy.  
- **Exercise:**  
  1. Set a **slow metronome** (60 BPM).  
  2. Play every **other note** (skip one) and name it. Example: **E â†’ G â†’ B â†’ D â†’ F**.  
  3. Try to stay in rhythm while calling out the notes.  

---

#### **Day 6: Find the Notes in Songs**  
- **Goal:** Recognize notes in real music.  
- **Exercise:**  
  1. Pick **a song or riff you already know** and identify which notes are natural.  
  2. Call out the note names instead of thinking of frets.  

---

#### **Day 7: Test Yourself (All Over the Neck)**  
- **Goal:** Be able to find any natural note **instantly** on the **E and A strings**.  
- **Exercise:**  
  1. Look at a note name (without the string) and locate **all instances** of that note on both strings.  
  2. Example: Find **C**  
     - E string: **8th fret**  
     - A string: **3rd fret**  
  3. Do this for all natural notes!
