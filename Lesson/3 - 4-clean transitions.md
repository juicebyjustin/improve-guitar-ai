Practicing clean transitions between power chords and single-note runs, along with locking in palm muting, can be tricky at first, but with some focused exercises and strategies, you'll get better with consistency. Here are some tips to help:

### **Exercises for Clean Transitions Between Power Chords & Single-Note Runs:**

1. **Start Slow:**
   - Begin by practicing each part (power chord and single-note run) separately at a slow tempo. Make sure you're cleanly transitioning between them without any slop or dead notes.
   - Use a metronome to gradually increase the speed once you can play them cleanly at a slow pace.

2. **Focus on Finger Placement:**
   - When switching between power chords and single-note runs, make sure your fingers stay close to the fretboard to avoid extra movement. This will help you transition smoothly and efficiently.
   - For power chords, keep your fingers relaxed but firm, and for single-note runs, make sure you’re using the tips of your fingers for maximum clarity.

3. **Practice Specific Chord Transitions:**
   - Pick a set of power chords and a scale or single-note run you want to practice transitioning between. For example, if you’re moving from a G5 power chord to a scale run in G major, practice that transition repeatedly.
   - Pay attention to the point of contact between your hand and the neck. Being mindful of your wrist position and finger pressure can prevent mistakes.

4. **Segment Transitions:**
   - Break down the transition into smaller steps. For example, practice transitioning from just the final note of a single-note run to the first note of the power chord, and vice versa. Once you can cleanly do these small chunks, link them together.

### **Strategies for Locking in Palm Muting:**

1. **Adjust Palm Placement:**
   - Place the edge of your palm lightly on the strings near the bridge to create a muted sound. The closer to the bridge, the more pronounced the muting effect.
   - Experiment with moving your palm slightly up or down the strings until you find a balance between clarity and muting.

2. **Palm Muting with Power Chords:**
   - Practice palm muting with power chords by strumming slowly and focusing on the depth of the palm mute. Adjust the pressure to get a consistent, percussive sound. 
   - Start with basic power chords, then progress to full progressions while maintaining a steady muting pressure.

3. **Incorporate Rhythmic Consistency:**
   - Palm muting can sound offbeat if not properly locked in with rhythm. Start practicing muted strums with a metronome or along with backing tracks. Focus on locking in the mute with the beat.

4. **Alternate Strumming & Palm Muting:**
   - Alternate between muted strums and open strums (where the strings aren’t muted) in your practice. For example, play a power chord with a palm mute, then switch to a single-note run without muting.
   - This will help you develop control over muting while maintaining clarity in your non-muted notes.

5. **Use Dynamic Palm Muting:**
   - Don’t always play palm muting at the same intensity. Vary the strength of your muting to create a dynamic effect in your playing, making it more expressive.

By focusing on finger placement, breaking down transitions, and consistently working on your palm muting technique, you’ll notice cleaner transitions and more controlled muting. It’s all about steady, focused practice.

Sure! Here are some simple tabs and licks to practice clean transitions between power chords and single-note runs, as well as incorporating palm muting.

### **1. Power Chord + Single-Note Run Transition (G5 Power Chord to G Major Scale)**

**Power Chord (G5):**
```
e|-------------------|
B|-------------------|
G|-------------------|
D|---5---5-----------|
A|---5---5-----------|
E|---3---3-----------|
```

**Single-Note Run (G Major Scale):**
```
e|----------------------------|
B|----------------------------|
G|------------------4-5-------|
D|--------4-5-7--------------|
A|---5-7----------------------|
E|----------------------------|
```

**Transition Example:**

Play the **G5 power chord** and then immediately jump to the **G major scale**. Start slow, and gradually increase the tempo. Make sure to mute the strings slightly after the power chord to get a clean, controlled transition into the scale.

### **2. Palm Muted Power Chords**

Here's an exercise to practice palm muting with power chords.

**Palm Muted Power Chords (D5 to C5 to G5):**

```
e|-------------------------------------------|
B|-------------------------------------------|
G|-------------------------------------------|
D|---7---7---5---5---5---5-------------------|
A|---5---5---3---3---5---5-------------------|
E|-------------------------------------------|
  PM----    PM----    PM----
```
**Legend:**
- "PM" stands for **palm mute**. Rest the edge of your palm lightly on the strings near the bridge.
- Start slow, ensuring that each power chord is muted with a consistent, percussive sound.

---

### **3. Single-Note Run with Palm Muting**

**Single-Note Run in G Major (with palm muting on the lower strings):**

```
e|---------------------------|
B|---------------------------|
G|---------------------------|
D|-----------------5-7-------|
A|---5-7---5-7-8-------------|
E|---3---5-------------------|
   PM---     PM---   PM
```

For this lick, palm mute the low **E** and **A** strings. As you move to the higher strings, release the muting to let the notes ring out more clearly. This combination of muted and open notes creates a dynamic effect.

---

### **4. Power Chord + Scale Slide Transition (D5 to A5 with a Slide to G Major)**

**Power Chords:**
```
e|----------------------|
B|----------------------|
G|---7----9-------------|
D|---7----9-------------|
A|---5----7-------------|
E|----------------------|
```

**G Major Scale (after slide):**
```
e|----------------------------|
B|----------------------------|
G|------------------4-5-------|
D|--------4-5-7--------------|
A|---5-7----------------------|
E|----------------------------|
```

**Transition Example:**
- Start by playing **D5** power chord and **A5** power chord.
- Slide from the **A5** to the **G Major Scale** immediately after, maintaining smooth transitions.
- Focus on cleanly muting the low end of the power chords as you switch to the scale, then let the scale ring out.

### **5. Palm Muting with Strumming (Rhythmic Exercise)**

A rhythm exercise with palm muting on downstrokes. Practice this with a slow metronome to lock in the rhythm.

```
e|-------------------------------|
B|-------------------------------|
G|-------------------------------|
D|---5---5---5---5---5---5---5---5|
A|---5---5---5---5---5---5---5---5|
E|---3---3---3---3---3---3---3---3|
    PM--- PM--- PM--- PM--- PM---
```

- Alternate between muted and open strums. For example, strum a muted downstroke, then an open strum, then mute again.
- Focus on syncing the mute with the beats and keeping a steady rhythm.

---

### **Tips for Practice:**
- Start at a slower tempo and increase gradually as you get more comfortable.
- Keep your palm mute consistent—don’t press too hard or too lightly. The goal is a percussive, muted sound.
- Practice transitions without stopping between sections, ensuring fluidity between power chords and single-note runs.

Feel free to experiment with these examples and modify them for your own playing!
