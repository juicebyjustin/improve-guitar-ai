Nice! That palm muting tip makes a lot of sense‚Äîstaccato quarter notes need that clean cutoff, or things can get muddy. Sounds like a solid lesson.  

### **What to Expect Next Week**  
Since your teacher mentioned **E minor shape, positions, and diatonic**, here‚Äôs what that likely means:  

#### **1. E Minor Shape & Positions**  
- Probably **talking about the E minor scale across the neck** in different **CAGED** positions.  
- You might start with the **open position** (like the open E minor pentatonic) and move up to **box shapes** higher up the neck.  

#### **2. Diatonic in E Minor**  
- ‚ÄúDiatonic‚Äù just means **sticking to the notes of the key** (E minor in this case).  
- Expect to work on **E minor scale patterns**, including **natural minor (Aeolian)** and maybe **harmonic/melodic minor**.  
- He might show you **how chords are built** in E minor using the diatonic scale (i.e., Em, F#dim, G, Am, Bm, C, D).  
- If you‚Äôre working on **riffs or leads**, he could show **how the diatonic scale fits over the power chords** in *Welcome Home*.  

### **What You Can Prep for Next Lesson**  
1. **Review the E Minor Scale**  
   - **Open position:** E - F# - G - A - B - C - D - E  
   - **5th fret position (A string root, CAGED system)**  
   - If you don‚Äôt know these yet, it‚Äôs fine! But being familiar will help.  

2. **Look at the Riffs in Welcome Home**  
   - See where they fit into the **E minor scale** (your teacher might break that down).  

3. **Practice Palm Muting & Staccato Chords More**  
   - Since that was a key issue last time, cleaning that up will free up lesson time for new material.  

Let me know if you want any **diagrams or tabs** to get a head start! üé∏üî•


Awesome! Here‚Äôs what I can do to help you get a head start:  

### **1. E Minor Scale Diagrams (Diatonic & Pentatonic)**  
I can provide **fretboard diagrams** showing:  
- **E minor scale (natural minor/Aeolian) across the neck**  
- **E minor pentatonic scale (common for metal & rock)**  
- **E minor scale in CAGED positions**  

---

### **2. Tabs & Exercises**  
I can write out:  
- **Basic E minor scale tabs** (in open position & movable shapes)  
- **CAGED system positions for E minor**  
- **Practice licks based on Welcome Home‚Äôs riffs**  
- **Palm muting exercises** with power chords & staccato notes  
- **Finger grouping exercises applied to E minor runs**  

---

### **3. Theory Breakdown (if helpful)**  
- **How diatonic chords work in E minor** (what chords are built from the scale)  
- **How to connect power chords & scale shapes**  

---

### **4. Tips for Practicing Clean Transitions**  
- Exercises to **switch between power chords & single-note runs cleanly**  
- Strategies for **locking in palm muting**  

Let me know which of these would help most! I can send tabs, diagrams, or explanations based on what you want to focus on. üé∏üî•
