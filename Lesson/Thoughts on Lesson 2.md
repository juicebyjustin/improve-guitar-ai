a song i'm learning has 8th note power chord changes with 8th note single fret single string runs between the power chords. i'm not playing cleanly between the chord changes. 

i'm planning what would best be fit to work on during my guitar lesson today. my teach told me to work on the Finger Grouping Exercises for Guitar and learn the notes on the fretboard on low E and A string. I've been working on that, but it takes time to master. I want to get the most out of my 1hr lesson today. Would it be a good thing to ask to work on me playing cleanly? or how would my time be better spent? i know that i can learn to play fast sticking to the exercises so i don't want to kill lesson time walking through the Finger Grouping Exercises for Guitar or naming notes on the fretboard.


Thatâ€™s a great way to think about your lesson timeâ€”maximizing what **you canâ€™t easily do alone** and keeping independent drills separate. Hereâ€™s how Iâ€™d approach it:  

### **Best Use of Lesson Time Today**  
âœ… **Yes, ask your teacher to help you play cleanly between power chord changes and single-note runs.**  
- Your issue is about **accuracy and transitions,** which is best corrected with real-time feedback.  
- Your teacher can **analyze your hand movements** and find inefficiencies (e.g., unnecessary motion, muting issues, or tension).  

### **How to Structure the Lesson**  
1. **Warm-Up (~5 min)**  
   - Quick run-through of **power chord changes + single-note runs** to show your teacher where you're struggling.  
   - Keep it at a **moderate tempo** so they can see/hear what's happening.  

2. **Technique Refinement (~20 min)**  
   - **Break down** one tricky transition at a time.  
   - Work on **hand positioning** (e.g., lifting fingers too much, bad angle on single-note runs).  
   - Use **slow, precise repetition** with small tempo increases.  

3. **Efficiency & Economy of Motion (~20 min)**  
   - Analyze **which fingers are moving too much or too little.**  
   - Work on **muting techniques** (so your chord changes sound tight).  
   - Try **legato techniques** (pull-offs/hammer-ons) to smooth out single-note runs.  

4. **Integration With the Song (~15 min)**  
   - **Practice transitions in context** at a slow speed.  
   - Gradually **speed it up** using a metronome.  
   - If time allows, work on **dynamics and attack** (how hard youâ€™re picking).  

### **What to Work on Independently**  
- **Finger Grouping Drills & Fretboard Notes** (since you can do these efficiently on your own).  
- **Metronome practice** to reinforce precision after the lesson.  

This way, your **lesson time fixes your biggest problem**, and your practice time reinforces it. ðŸŽ¸ðŸ”¥ Sound like a good plan?
