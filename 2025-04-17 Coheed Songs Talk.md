If you’re comfortably playing scales and finger drills at **160 BPM** with **eighth notes**, that puts you in a solid spot to start tackling a lot of Coheed's groovier, proggier riffs — especially the mid-tempo ones. You may not be shredding Claudio’s fastest parts *yet*, but you’ve got the dexterity to start digging into a bunch of fan favorites.

Here’s a list of **Coheed songs with fun prog riffs** you could likely start learning and feel pretty good playing:

---

### 🔹 **Entry-Mid Level (Good Fit for Your Current Speed)**
These are more groove-based or less dense with technical speed, but still sound super impressive.

- **“The Suffering”**  
  - That intro riff is iconic, syncopated, and fun. Moderate tempo, catchy and punchy.

- **“A Favor House Atlantic”**  
  - The main riff is straightforward, and the chorus is powerful. Good stamina test with some riffy palm-muted runs.

- **“In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3”**  
  - You can start with the intro riff. It’s not too fast but super dynamic and layered — great for working on tone, energy, and phrasing.

- **“No World for Tomorrow”**  
  - This one grooves hard. The opening riff is chunky and rhythmic, and the tempo won’t blow you up.

- **“Ten Speed (of God’s Blood and Burial)”**  
  - Great riffing that’s mid-fast, but repetitive enough to get under your fingers quickly.

---

### 🔹 **Moderate Difficulty (Pushes You Slightly Beyond 160 BPM)**
These may challenge your stamina or picking speed slightly but are within reach, especially at 160 BPM eighths.

- **“Blood Red Summer”**  
  - The verse riff is subtle and tight. Good right-hand work without overloading the left.

- **“Cuts Marked in the March of Men”**  
  - The main riff has a great groove and involves movement up and down the neck — awesome for training accuracy.

- **“The Crowing”**  
  - This one dips into odd rhythms and phrasing — very rewarding. The intro and verse riffs are crunchy and syncopated.

- **“Deranged” (if you're into B-sides)**  
  - Has a slightly metal edge, but it's fun and riffy in a different way than the usual Coheed material.

---

### 🔹 Tips While Learning:
- Start at **75-80% speed** and build up.
- Practice with a **backing drum track** or metronome for tight timing.
- If your finger drills are clean at 160, you might be ready for **sixteenth notes at 80-100 BPM**, which opens up even more.

“The Suffering” i stuggle with some of the transitions and the slide in the intro riff.

“A Favor House Atlantic”: this has a fun intro, but the rest of the song is power chords.

“In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3” - i actually have like 90% perfected. some of the clean parts i could stand to practice and i'm sure i can play well now that i've grown a little bit in skill.

“No World for Tomorrow” - the intro is insane. 16th notes at 100bpm. That's 40bpm faster than my current 160bpm 8th notes.

“Blood Red Summer” - looks very doable.

“Cuts Marked in the March of Men” - this sounds and tab looks doable.

“The Crowing” - i can play most of this. about midway through there's 30-60 seconds that has very hard riffs like the fast 16th notes after the low power chords.


why does 16th notes at 80 bpm open much more? it's the same speed.

Great breakdown — you’ve got a solid sense of where your skills are, and honestly you're *right on the edge* of leveling into some seriously satisfying riffs. Let’s hit a few of your points and then dive into your really insightful question about note speed.

### 🎸 Your Song Progress Rundown:

- **“The Suffering”** – Totally fair. That intro slide and phrasing can trip anyone up. Worth slowing it way down and focusing just on the transitions in isolation — like loop just the 2–3 note parts before and after the slide until they feel seamless.

- **“A Favor House Atlantic”** – Yup, it’s more about vibe and performance than technical depth. Might be more fun live than as a practice piece.

- **“IKSSE:3”** – 🔥 That’s awesome. It’s a dynamic track and being close to mastering it shows how far you’ve come.

- **“No World for Tomorrow”** – Yeah, 16ths at 100 BPM = 200 notes per minute. Respect for noticing how much of a jump that is from 160 eighths (which is 160 notes per minute). Still, it’s a great future benchmark.

- **“Blood Red Summer”** and **“Cuts Marked…”** – Definitely great picks for your current skill level. Both work the rhythmic side of prog without overloading speed or accuracy.

- **“The Crowing”** – The part you’re stuck on might be a good micro-goal. Even isolating and mastering 10 seconds of that fast section could move your playing forward big time.

### 🧠 Why Do 16th Notes at 80 BPM "Open Things Up"?

You’re *totally* right that **160 eighth notes per minute = 80 sixteenth notes per minute** in terms of raw note count. But there’s a **psychological and structural difference** that makes 16th notes at 80 BPM feel like a milestone:

1. **Most songs are written in 16ths for rhythm guitar**  
   Once you’re comfortable thinking and playing in 16ths, you unlock a *huge* percentage of modern rock/prog riffs, because most rhythmic patterns (chugs, syncopation, funkier grooves) are built on 16th subdivisions. You’re syncing with the "feel" of pro rhythm guitarists.

2. **Backing tracks and drum grooves**  
   Drummers lay down grooves in 16ths. Being able to track with a hi-hat or snare groove in 16ths makes you *lock in* way more with the pocket.

3. **Tab and learning resources**  
   Most intermediate+ guitar tabs (like Coheed, Periphery, Karnivool, etc.) write their trickier riffs using 16ths. Being able to read/play them at face value without mental math = time saved and more efficient learning.

4. **Gateway to sixteenths at higher BPMs**  
   Once your fingers are used to the feel of 16ths at 80, it’s easier to scale to 90, 100, and beyond. It’s like breaking into a new gear on a bike — the ramp-up becomes smoother.

So while yes, you're playing the same *speed* as 160 BPM 8ths, you're shifting to a new **mental framework and rhythm grid**, and that’s a massive unlock long-term.
